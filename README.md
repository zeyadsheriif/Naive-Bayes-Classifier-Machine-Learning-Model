# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Machine-Learning-Model

Project Objective:
In this project, we will implement a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic with built-in libraries. You will use
the Titanic dataset, which contains various features about the passengers, to train and evaluate your model.

project Tasks:

1- Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Load the train and test datasets using pandas.
Explore the data to understand the features and their types.
Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputing or
removing).
Convert categorical features into numerical ones using
techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalize or scale the features if necessary. 

2-Feature Selection:
Select the features you will use to train your model.
Justify your choices.

3-Model Implementation and Evaluation:
Implement a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn. You
may choose between GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, or BernoulliNB based on your
feature types.
Train your model on the training dataset.
Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics, such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the robustness of your
model.

4- Prediction:
Use your trained model to make predictions on the test
dataset.
